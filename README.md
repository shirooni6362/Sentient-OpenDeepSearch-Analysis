## What This Paper Covers

This is a 130-page technical analysis examining:

- **Architecture**: Modular design with dual reasoning agents (ReAct & CodeAct)
- **Performance**: 88.3% on SimpleQA, 75.3% on FRAMES (9.7pp better than GPT-4o on complex tasks)
- **Economics**: Cost breakdown, TCO modeling, 80-90% savings at scale through self-hosting
- **Production**: Scalability, reliability, monitoring, and deployment guidance
- **Ecosystem**: Open Model License framework for sustainable development
- **Limitations**: Honest assessment of gaps and future research directions
